Both repoA and repoB were initially standalone repositories, so I create a new repository that will serve as the unified project. I initiated a new Git repository, which will house both repoA and repoB as submodules. Each repository was added as a submodule within the root directory of the unified repository(.gitmodules) that includes the url for each repo. Both repositories relied on a common configuration file, config.yaml, for managing settings such as local development parameters and environment-specific configurations. To ensure compatibility across both submodules, I implemented a shared configuration loader function (load_config()) that retrieves settings from config.yaml.
